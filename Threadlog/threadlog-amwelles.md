# Threadlog Version by Autumn Welles
This original version by default will show all threads from all forums unless you explicitly set the "Include in threadlog" checkbox via Edit Forum settings for at least one forum. For RP's this can get a little heavy on includes, particularly if your game has loads of IC forums. If you're looking for the alternative, where you may exclude OOC forums instead, you will want to use the version of this plugin by ᓚᘏᗢ (also known as: crypticat/eshye/pumpkinspired).
