# Content Restricted (Age Verification)
Require users to certify their age via a form check stored as a cookie; similar to Jcink's age verification process.

Age is stored as a cookie on the users local machine which means it is not stored on the database and the information is not processed or delievered to you. They must input their age and if the age is not equal to or older than your age requirement they will be redirected to a no permissions page.

## Custom Message
This plugin also allows for a custom message to be entered that will display below the age collection table. Here you can describe why you have an age gate or any other details you wish, this is not required for the plugin to work though.
