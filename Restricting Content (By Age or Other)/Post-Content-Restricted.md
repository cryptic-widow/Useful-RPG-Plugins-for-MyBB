# Post Content Restricted
Restrict the content of posts from guest view in all forums except the ones you choose to keep public. Guests will still be able to see these boards and the thread listing within them but when they open the thread it will give them the "No Permissions" error.
- This plugin was built on MyBB version 1.8.33 but should work well with any 1.8 versions.

## My Notes On This
This plugin is useful in the sense that you can restrict guests from actually reading the content of threads in certain forums but you can exclude some to still be visible by guests (such as your advertising board). Your game will still look active because guests can see the thread lists and the amount but they will not be able to see the content written within.

Pair this would disabling guests from viewing profiles (if they contain content you don't want guests to see) along with [Date of Birth on Registration](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=view&pid=808) and you've got a game that is protected from minors if you're 18+ for example.
